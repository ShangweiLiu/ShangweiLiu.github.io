I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Belfer Center’s Environment and Natural Resources Program and the Science, Technology, and Public Policy Program. My research focuses on accelerating clean energy innovation and deployment, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and costs while maximizing co-benefits and equity. I hold a Ph.D. in Science, Technology, and Environmental Policy from Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs and a bachelor’s degree in Environmental Science from Beijing Normal University.
